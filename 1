 one big mess
   1-index folder btn is indexing all file not a particular folder. as after clicking it is showing 664 and i think i have this much doc is avilable
   2-first btn re-index all is deleting all but not rebuiding as after clicking count is 0 and refresh is also showing 0
   3-index current note is not indexing as after this count is still 0 and refresh btn is also showing 0

   so what do you think re-index may be named to reset.
   index folder may be renamed as Index-all
   index current note need updation.
   after all this we may go for a current note  folder btn
